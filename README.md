Hi, my name is Akshat Mardia. I’m currently a rising junior learning Electrical and Computer Engineering at University of Washington, Seattle.
I’m looking to collaborate on interesting projects that involve hardware development in the robotics sector. I have done various robotics
projects in the past and if you'd like to know more about it then you cant contact me on discord. I’m currently interested in improving
my web development skills and in the process of constructing a dynamic website for my blog which will act as my personal website as well.

My discord is Akshat#1877.
