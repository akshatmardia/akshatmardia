Hi, my name is Akshat Mardia. I’m currently a senior in Electrical and Computer Engineering at University of Washington, Seattle.
I’m looking to collaborate on interesting projects that involve software and hardware development in the robotics sector. I have done various
robotics projects in the past and if you'd like to know more about it then you can contact me on discord.

My discord is @akshatmardia.
