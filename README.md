Hi, my name is Akshat Mardia. I’m currently a senior in Electrical and Computer Engineering at University of Washington, Seattle.
I’m looking to collaborate on interesting projects that involve software and hardware development in the robotics sector. I have done various
robotics projects in the past and if you'd like to know more about it then you can contact me on discord. I’m currently working on improving
my web development skills and in the process of constructing a dynamic website for my blog.

My discord is @akshatmardia.
